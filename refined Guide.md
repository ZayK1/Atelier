## 🎯 Why "Atelier"?

The name **Atelier** (pronounced *ah-tel-YAY*) comes from the French word for "workshop" or "studio" — traditionally a space where artists, craftspeople, and apprentices gather to learn, create, and perfect their craft under the guidance of master artisans.

### The Perfect Metaphor for Modern Software Development

- **🎨 Living Workshop**: Your projects become ongoing learning environments where architecture evolves with guidance
- **👨‍🏫 Continuous Mentorship**: AI-powered architectural guidance that grows with your project
- **🔧 Hands-On Mastery**: Learn by doing, with real-time feedback on your actual code
- **📈 Progressive Learning**: Start simple, scale complex, always with best practices
- **⚡ Practical Craftsmanship**: Architecture skills learned through real project implementation

*Atelier embodies our refined vision: a companion platform where architectural mastery is developed through continuous practice on real projects.*
