## 🎯 Why "Atelier"?

The name **Atelier** (pronounced *ah-tel-YAY*) comes from the French word for "workshop" or "studio" — traditionally a space where artists, craftspeople, and apprentices gather to learn, create, and perfect their craft under the guidance of master artisans.

### The Perfect Metaphor for Modern Software Development

- **🎨 Creative Workshop**: Just as painters learn composition and technique in an atelier, developers learn architectural patterns and design principles
- **👨‍🏫 Master-Apprentice Model**: Our AI-powered guidance acts as the experienced mentor, providing personalized instruction and feedback
- **🔧 Hands-On Learning**: Theory meets practice in a supportive environment where ideas transform into tangible projects
- **🤝 Community of Practice**: Peer learning, collaboration, and knowledge sharing are fundamental to the atelier experience
- **⚡ Modern Craftsmanship**: In the AI era, software architecture becomes the new artisanal skill — requiring creativity, judgment, and deep understanding

*Atelier embodies our vision: a digital workshop where the craft of software architecture is learned, practiced, and perfected.*
