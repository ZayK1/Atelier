## 💰 Enhanced Budget & Cost Management

### 💵 MVP Budget Breakdown (30 Days)

| Category | Cost | Features Enabled | Optimization Strategy |
|----------|------|------------------|----------------------|
| **AI APIs** | $25-40 | Claude diagrams + ChatGPT Q&A + Smart caching | Daily usage monitoring + aggressive caching |
| **Hosting** | $0 | Vercel free tier (sufficient for MVP traffic) | Optimize for free tier limits |
| **Storage** | $0 | Vercel KV free tier + localStorage fallback | Smart data management |
| **Domain** | $0 | Use .vercel.app subdomain initially | Custom domain after validation |
| **Development Tools** | $0 | VS Code + free GitHub + Figma free tier | Open source tooling |
| **Design Assets** | $0 | Free icons (Lucide) + fonts + Tailwind UI | Curated free resources |
| **Analytics** | $0 | Vercel Analytics free tier | Built-in analytics |
| **Total MVP Cost** | **$25-40** | Full-featured visual architecture platform | Ultra-cost-effective validation |

### 🎯 AI Cost Optimization Strategy

```typescript
const aiCostOptimization = {
  claude: {
    usage: "Diagram generation only (high value, low frequency)",
    caching: "Cache all diagrams for 7 days",
    batching: "Generate multiple related diagrams in single request",
    optimization: "Reuse diagram components across templates"
  },
  
  chatgpt: {
    usage: "Q&A and explanations (cost-effective, high frequency)",
    model: "gpt-3.5-turbo (lowest cost option)",
    limits: "10 questions per user per day for free tier",
    caching: "Cache common architecture questions for 24 hours"
  },
  
  smartCaching: {
    diagrams: "Hash-based caching by project structure",
    responses: "Cache architectural Q&A by question similarity",
    templates: "Pre-generate all template diagrams at build time",
    userContext: "Cache user preferences and project context"
  },
  
  usageTiers: {
    free: "5 AI interactions per day",
    pro: "50 AI interactions per day ($10/month)",
    enterprise: "Unlimited interactions ($25/month)"
  }
};
```

  test('displays architecture diagram', async () => {
    render(<TemplateSelector />);
    fireEvent.click(screen.getByText('React SPA Professional'));
    await waitFor(() => {
      expect(document.querySelector('svg')).toBeInTheDocument();
    });
  });
});
```

### ✅ Performance Optimization
```typescript
// lib/performance/optimizations.ts
export const performanceOptimizations = {
  // Lazy load heavy components
  LazyMermaidDiagram: lazy(() => import('@/components/diagrams/MermaidDiagram')),
  LazyTemplatePreview: lazy(() => import('@/components/templates/TemplatePreview')),
  
  // Cache management
  cacheStrategy: {
    diagrams: 7 * 24 * 60 * 60 * 1000, // 7 days
    aiResponses: 24 * 60 * 60 * 1000,   // 1 day
    templates: Infinity                   // Never expire
  },
  
  // Bundle optimization
  bundleOptimization: {
    splitRoutes: true,
    preloadCritical: ['templates', 'diagrams'],
    prefetchOnHover: true
  }
};
```
